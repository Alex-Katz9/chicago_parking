From the set of all men and women, we see that the most matches played goes to Rafael Nadal with 28.

The highest first serve percentage in a match was 93% by S Errani.

__What are the unforced error percentages of the top three players with the most wins? (Unforced error percentage is % of points lost due to unforced errors. In a match, you have fields for number of points won by each player, and number of unforced errors for each field.)__

SELECT name, SUM(count) AS total_wins, SUM(errors)/SUM(points_lost) AS unforced_error_percent  
FROM errors  
GROUP BY name  
ORDER BY total_wins DESC;

The top three in wins (Nadal, Ferrer, and Wawrinka) had unforced error percentages of 23.5, 23.5, 26.8, respectively.

Hint: SUM(double_faults) sums the contents of an entire column. For each row, to add the field values from two columns, the syntax SELECT name, double_faults + unforced_errors can be used.

Special bonus hint: To be careful about handling possible ties, consider using rank functions.
